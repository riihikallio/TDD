# TDD exercise of Conway's Game of Life

You can run the program by giving `life.mjs` execution permissions. You can also run it as `node life.mjs`.

You need to provide an RLE encoded file to initialize. `glider.rle` is provided as an example.

To run the glider for 5 ticks use `./life.mjs -t 5 glider.rle`

The output is RLE encoded by default. Use `-p` to get cleartext output. Use `-h` for help.
